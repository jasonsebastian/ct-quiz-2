# Comp Thinking Quiz 2

## Prerequisite
You must have Python 3 installed on your computer. If you don't have Python 3, go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it on your computer.

To verify that Python has been installed, run this command on your terminal.
```
python --version
pip --version
```

The output should look something like:
```
Python 3.7.9
pip 20.2.4 from c:\users\jason\appdata\local\programs\python\python37\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.7)
```

If the installation went well, run this command:
```
pip install pytest
```

Go to [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qqd_xvksZ0IHPPJv0Y4avSqEfmZ8hbdq/view?usp=sharing) and download the `.zip` file. Upon extracting, you will find four files.
- `tournament.py`. This is where you'll write your code.
- `tournament_test.py`. A test file. Go to heading [Running the tests](#running-the-tests) for more details.
- `input.txt`. An input file.
- `output_sample.txt`. Sample of an output file.

## Instruction
Tally the results of a small football competition.

Based on an input file containing which team played against which and what the outcome was, create a file with a table like this:
```
Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P
Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7
Allegoric Alaskans             |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6
Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3
Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1
```

What do those abbreviations mean?
- MP: Matches Played
- W: Matches Won
- D: Matches Drawn (Tied)
- L: Matches Lost
- P: Points

A win earns a team 3 points. A draw earns 1. A loss earns 0.

The outcome should be ordered by points, descending. In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.

## Input

Your tallying program will receive input that looks like:
```
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
Devastating Donkeys;Allegoric Alaskans;win
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
Blithering Badgers;Devastating Donkeys;loss
Allegoric Alaskans;Courageous Californians;win
```

The result of the match refers to the first team listed. So this line
```
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
```
means that the Allegoric Alaskans beats the Blithering Badgers.

This line:
```
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
```
means that the Blithering Badgers beats the Courageous Californians.

And this line:
```
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
```
means that the Devastating Donkeys and Courageous Californians tied.

## Running the tests
To run the tests, run `pytest tournament_test.py`. Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the `pytest` module: `python -m pytest tournament_test.py`.

If your program passes all tests, you should see something like:
```
=============================== test session starts ===============================
platform win32 -- Python 3.7.9, pytest-6.1.2, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1
rootdir: C:\Users\jason\Google Drive\Personal\Comp Thinking\2020-12-12 Quiz 2

=============================== 11 passed in 0.10s ================================
```

## Verifying
You might also want to check if the `output.txt` generated by your code matches `output_sample.txt`. If the contents of the two files match, your program works as expected.
